## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a set of bash scripts that gather data on hardware specifications of nodes within the linux cluster, monitor their resource usage in real time, and store the data to a PSQL database maintained in a docker instance.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Not started.
  - JDBC App: Created a JDBC application that implements DAO's in a JDBC system. 
  - Grep App: Developed an application that mirrors the Linux bash grep function to search for a matching regex pattern in a directory.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam/tree/master/springboot)]: Not started

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: Not started.

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam/tree/master/hadoop)]: Not started.

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam/tree/master/spark)]: Not started.

**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KeithanBalasubramaniam/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: Not started.


## Highlighted Projects
**AI Personal Trainer** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_profile_builder)]: Designed an application where a user can follow along an exercise routine by a trainer on a video, and dynamically receive real time feedback on quality of form as a score. Developed application's body tracking algorithim in Python using OpenCV and TensorFlow. Implemented convolutional neural networking and dynamic time warping to compute real time user scoring metrics.

**Peer-to-Peer Application ** [[GitHub](https://github.com/KeithanBala/AI-Personal-Trainer)]: Created an application that allows exchanges of files and media among connected peer networks. Implemented UDP and TCP connections with an index server and peer networks using sockets in C. Designed functionalities for users to upload and delete files to be shared to other connected peer networks via the index server.

**Intelligent Autonomous Robot Car**: Implemented a maze solving algorithim in Assembly on a miniature robot car to react to obstacles and dead end paths to allow the robot to learn all possible routes through the maze. Integrated sensors to read, and follow possible paths to traverse the maze backwards.
