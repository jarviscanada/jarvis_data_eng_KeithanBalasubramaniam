# Introduction
This application is a Twitter Command Line Interface that is able to create, search, and delete
tweets in real time based on user input. The app uses the Twitter REST API to enable
these functionalities through an HTTP Client to run the requests and uses the Jackson Library to parse
and convert the JSON objects to Tweet Objects. This application is packaged using Docker, where user's can 
pull the image from DockerHub to be implemented. The technologies used to create this application are as follows:

- Java
- Spring
